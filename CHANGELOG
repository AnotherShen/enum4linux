2007-12-05 Enum4Linux v0.8.0

* Added -a option to try all simple enumeration.  You don't
  need to remember long complicated command line options now.
* Gets domain groups and domain group memberships now.
  enum.exe fails to do this sometimes, so this feature is
  actually incompatible with the original. :-)
* Made RID cycling more robust: by default it now tries a list 
  of common usernames (administrator, guest, root, ...) to get 
  initial SID.
* The "-k username" take a list of usernames to use when
  attempting to get the SID.  Previously only supported one.
* -d option implemented.  Displays detailed information about
  users (primary group, last logon, password change info, etc.)
  and groups (description, number of members).
* Attempts to get Domain SID to determine if the host is
  in a domain or in a workgroup.  Experimental.
* Added -i option to get info about printers.
* During RID cycling, the type of account discovered is
  now displayed (Local User, Domain Group, etc.).
