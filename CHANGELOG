2008-09-16 Enum4linux v0.8.3

* Now tries to get all SIDs for target before RID cycling.
  This should result in local, domain and builtin accounts
  being enumerated - even parent domains sometimes.
* Runs polenum.py (if installed) to get password policy.

2008-03-28 Enum4linux v0.8.2

* Changed HTTP link to point at new labs website.

2007-12-05 Enum4Linux v0.8.1

* nmblookup/nbtstat output now contains human-readable
  descriptions.
* Clearer messages about why RID cycling has failed
  (either can't get SID or RID cycling not allowed).

2007-12-05 Enum4Linux v0.8.0

* Added -a option to try all simple enumeration. You don't
  need to remember long complicated command line options now.
* Gets domain groups and domain group memberships now.
  enum.exe fails to do this sometimes, so this feature is
  actually incompatible with the original. :-)
* Made RID cycling more robust: by default it now tries a list
  of common usernames (administrator, guest, root, ...) to get
  initial SID.
* The "-k username" take a list of usernames to use when
  attempting to get the SID. Previously only supported one.
* -d option implemented. Displays detailed information about
  users (primary group, last logon, password change info, etc.)
  and groups (description, number of members).
* Attempts to get Domain SID to determine if the host is
  in a domain or in a workgroup. Experimental.
* Added -i option to get info about printers.
* During RID cycling, the type of account discovered is
  now displayed (Local User, Domain Group, etc.).
